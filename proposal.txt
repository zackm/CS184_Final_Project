CS184 Final Project Proposal

Team:
Tyler Brabham and Zack Mayeda

We plan to create a live fluid simulation, specifically simulating liquid in a container. We will model the fluid as particles interacting, and use the Lagrangian method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics to model the particle behavior. We will implement a neighbor algorithm for the particles to speed up computation.

We will work closely on the entire project, but we will split up some main portions of the work as follows:
Tyler: particle interaction
Zack: neighbor algorithm & caustics/raytracing

We discussed our idea with Jiamin.

Milestones Completed:
- 2D simulation
- particles are drawn as a colored isosurface in 2D using marching squares. (although does not look great)
- implement neighbors algorithm for speedup. (might be good to write out explicit run times for using neighbors algorithm and not using it).
- move simulation of particles into 3D
- particles drawn as isosurface in 3D. (will likely use a library for marching cubes).
- raytracer is capable of doing refraction
- output isosurface triangles to an obj format, or to the ray tracer assignment format.
- use raytracer to render image with realistic watery look.

Milestones to complete of high priority:
- use a better method (perhaps verlet) for differential equation (causing issues right now).
- speedup using parallel processing of particles.

Milestone to complete of low priority:
- texture mapping on the container.
- various shaped containers.
- interaction with solid objects.
- user interaction: toggle particle/isosurface, change viscosity, change number of particles.
- port to WebGL.
