CS184 Final Project Proposal

Team:
Tyler Brabham and Zack Mayeda

We plan to create a live fluid simulation, specifically simulating liquid in a container. We will model the fluid as particles interacting, and use the Lagrangian method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics to model the particle behavior. We will implement a neighbor algorithm for the particles to speed up computation.

We will work closely on the entire project, but we will split up some main portions of the work as follows:
Tyler: particle interaction
Zack: neighbor algorithm & caustics/raytracing

Milestones (we will complete as many as time permits):
- 2D simulation where particles are drawn as a colored isosurface
- move simulation into 3D
- implement neighbor algorithm
- raytraced reflections and caustics
- texture mapping on the container
- various shaped containers
- interaction with solid objects
- user interaction: toggle particle/isosurface, change viscosity, change number of particles
- port to WebGL

We discussed our idea with Jiamin.
